## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage

- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

- Apply API patterns with Redux
- Identify parts of interface that could be isolated into separate React components
- Build reusable React components
- Apply components into appropriate interface parts
- Style the interface using SCSS preprocessor
- Refactor the code

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Redux
- Axios
